the principle of separation of concerns in order 
to create robust, reusable components.
Limitations

Compared to other web frameworks, BlueBream has a 
rather high learning curve, especially for developers 
who are new to Python or the Zope framework.
BlueBeam might be difficult to utilize, particularly 
for simple or modest tasks.
Some developers may find the component-based architecture 
and enormous number of capabilities supplied by the 
framework to be daunting.
BlueBream is not as popular as other web frameworks such 
as Django or Flask, hence there may be fewer developers 
and fewer resources available to support it.
BlueBream’s performance can be slower than other web 
frameworks, particularly for large and complicated 
projects due to BlueBream-based Zope framework’s overhead.
Although BlueBream is designed to be scalable, 
it may not be the optimal solution for large, 
high-traffic applications that require horizontal 
scaling across numerous servers.
